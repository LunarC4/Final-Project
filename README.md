# Final-Project
Miku Dance Simulator is a simple sensory game. The program:
1. Lets the user move a leek (one of Miku's iconic symbols) around with a joystick.
2. Creates a colorful display that matches the cursor movements.
3. Gives a rewarding message at the end.

The Arduino Control.ido file connects the joystick to Processing.
finalproject contains the following:
1. finalproject.pde, which is the primary code for the game.
2. Beats.pde, which contains the classes used.
3. Miku.wav, leeku.png, mikudayo.png, and confetti.gif. The .wav file is the song that plays, and the images are part of the "game" and end screen.
